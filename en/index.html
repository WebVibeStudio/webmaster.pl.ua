        <h2>How to Create Your Website: Step-by-Step Algorithm</h2>

        <p>Creating a website is an exciting process that starts with an idea and ends with full functionality. Here’s a step-by-step algorithm on how to do it:</p>

        <h3>1. Define the purpose of your website</h3>
        <p>Before you start, decide why you need a website. It could be an online store, blog, portfolio, or corporate site.</p>

        <h3>2. Choose a name for the website</h3>
        <p>Think of a memorable and unique name that reflects the essence of your business. The name should be easy to spell and pronounce.</p>

        <h3>3. Choose a domain zone</h3>
        <p>Decide on a domain zone (.com, .ua, .net, etc.). This depends on your target audience and geographic location. For Ukrainian companies, the .ua zone is popular.</p>

        <h3>4. Pay for hosting services and domain registration</h3>
        <p>Choose a reliable hosting provider and pay for domain registration services. This will ensure your website is accessible on the internet.</p>

        <h3>5. Provide company information</h3>
        <p>Gather all necessary materials:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>Contact details (phone numbers, address)</li>
           <li>Photos of products and services</li>
           <li>Descriptions and prices of products or services</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Make an advance payment</h3>
        <p>After discussing all project details, make an advance payment to start work on your website.</p>

        <h3>7. Make changes to the website prototype</h3>
        <p>Review the website prototype and make necessary edits. Discuss all details with the developer so they can consider your wishes.</p>

        <h3>8. Accept the work</h3>
        <p>After the development is completed, test the website and ensure everything is working properly. If you are satisfied, accept the work.</p>

        <h3>9. Train staff if necessary</h3>
        <p>If needed, conduct training for your staff on how to manage the website. This will help your employees effectively use its functionality.</p>

        <h3>10. Pay the remaining balance for the work</h3>
        <p>After successful review and acceptance of the work, pay the remaining amount for the services.</p>

        <h3>11. Agree on website support</h3>
        <p>Discuss the terms of technical support and maintenance for your website. This will ensure its smooth operation and up-to-date information.</p>
